# Who are the Huskie Hackers?
Huskie Hackers is an organization of students seeking unique team building experience outside of the classroom at NIU. Our goal is to improve members’ technical and soft skills as well as bring networking opportunities needed for the professional field. We participate in hacking events such as in-person/online **Hackathons** and **Game Jams**. During our meetings, we have focused practices that prepare our team for said hacking events. We foster a competitive environment that brings every member together as a team to build a **meaningful project** and a memorable experience.
